                    Example 1

                    Data for baseline prompt: ['SERVICE AGREEMENT\n\nThis agreement is entered into between Client Corp ("Client") and\nService Provider Inc ("Provider").\n\n1. SERVICES\nProvider agrees to deliver software development services as specified\nin Exhibit A, including:\n- Custom web application development\n- Database design and implementation\n- API integration services\n\n2. PAYMENT\nClient agrees to pay Provider $50,000 upon completion of services.\nPayment is due within 30 days of invoice.\n\n3. TERM\nThis agreement is effective for 12 months from the signing date\nand may be extended by mutual written agreement.\n\n4. CONFIDENTIALITY\nBoth parties agree to maintain confidentiality of proprietary\ninformation exchanged during the course of this agreement.\n\n5. TERMINATION\nEither party may terminate this agreement with 30 days written notice.\nUpon termination, Client shall pay for all work completed to date.\n\n6.

This needs clarification. Provider could be giving up rights without getting paid.', "Termination Clause: The 'work completed to date' clause is vague.

Be as specific as possible.', '**Payment Schedule:** Implement a milestone-based payment schedule tied to completion of specific deliverables.

Define terms of IP usage if the agreement is terminated before full payment.', "**Termination Clause:** Define the method for calculating 'work completed to date' (e.g., based on hours worked, completed milestones). Add a clause specifying payment terms for partially completed milestones.", "**Warranty Clause:** Include a warranty clause detailing the period for which the software is guaranteed to function as intended and the Provider's obligations for fixing defects.", "**Liability Clause:** Add a liability clause that limits the Provider's liability for damages arising from the use of the software.", "**Confidentiality Clause:** Clearly define 'proprietary information' and outline specific obligations, permitted uses, and duration of confidentiality.", '**Dispute Resolution:** Include a clause specifying a process for resolving disputes (e.g., mediation, arbitration).', '**Indemnification Clause:** Add a clause requiring each party to indemnify the other against third-party claims arising from its actions or omissions.', '**Force Majeure Clause:** Include a clause excusing performance in the event of unforeseen circumstances (e.g., natural disasters, war).', 'Add a Change Order clause to address how changes to the scope of the services will be handled, including their impact on the payment schedule.']

FINAL INSTRUCTIONS
Iterate on the original prompt (above) with a new prompt that will improve the results, based on the examples and feedback above.

A common best practice in prompt optimization is to add guidelines and the most helpful few shot examples.

Note: Make sure to include the variables from the original prompt, which are wrapped in either single brackets or double brackets (e.g.
{var}). If you fail to include these variables, the LLM will not be able to access the required data.
Do not add any single or double brackets around anything other than the variables from the original prompt. The only curly brackets that should be used are the ones that wrap the variables from the original prompt.
Make sure to copy paste the exact return instructions from the original prompt. Do not add any brackets here.
